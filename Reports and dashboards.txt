			Reports & DashBoards
		-------------------------------------------
(1) Reports:-These are used to compile information by customizing the records & Fields based on some Query. These are used for 	     Analytics part.
	     Reports are simply the answers to a particular query where the query wants something related to data as the answer.

(2) Report Types:- Whenever you will go to the Reports tab in the Navigation-bar(top middle) of the Home Page View & then to New Report, You Would be asked to create a new Report type from pre-created/standard Report-types & you need to choose from them.

=> But In Salesforce, if we want to create the custom Report types, we can move to setup--> Quick find---> Type out...(Report Types.).

=> After Creating the Report Types, We can create the New Report by choosing any of the Report Types , editing the fields & finally you have created 1 report.

=> In Report Building phase, we can only see maximum of 20 records not all the available records , To see all available records we 
   need to save the records and run it.

   So, Report Types consists of:-
	(i) Objects  (One primary object & maximum 3 secondary objects).
        (ii) The Relationship between the Objects. ==> whether inner join or left Outer Join.
	(iii) Fields to be edited ( Although the relationship would have fetched all the available fields, but we can also 	              customize the required fields as well , as per our business need).

Let's define the above three points:-

(a) Objects :- These are Simply the Standard Objects/ Custom Objects Like:- Account,Cases,Oppotunities etc.	
	      => There must be a single Primary object ( let say Account) and attached to it are the Secondary Objects 
		 like Opportunities, Cases,Contacts etc. Having Secondary Objects are Optional. But Having a primary object is 
		 mandatory.
	      
	      => The Primary object is also called as Key Metrics.
	   (*) In a Single Report type, we can have maximum of 4 Objects.(one is the primary object,& Rest 3 can be secondary objects)

			The Real Case Example between the Primary Object & Secondary Object is:- 
			  (*) Accounts with Contacts. ( 2 objects in relation).
			  (*) Opportunities with Cases.( ' ' ).
			  (*) Accounts with Contacts with Opportunities.( 3 objects in relation).
			  
			
			  Here "with" represents that the two objects are related to each other.
			  The above three examples are in the same form as like it is in the Salesforce Reports Section to choose a 			          new Report type.

(b) The Relationship b/w the Objects... (One Report type can contain maximum of 4 Objects being related to each other).
   --------------------------------------
    (1) Inner join :- If this is the case, then only those records will be displayed which are common in Objects 'A' and 'B'.
    
    (2) Left Outer Join:- It will have All the Records from 'A' and the matching records from 'B'...Those records in 'A' who do not
			  have any matching record, then there will be null assigned for it.

    The Type of Relationship actually fetches & defines the number of records to be present in our Report.

    One Report can consist of maximum of 2000 records, before its being exported.
	
	        
   
	      
(c) Fields to be added:- We can Customize to show up the required fields in our Report.
   --------------------


(3) Report Formats:- This is the way how the Reports would be presented. There are 4 types of Report Formats:-
   -----------------    (i) Tabular :- This is all about arranging the data in a list format.
			(ii) Summary:- It is used for grouping & summarizing the data.
			(iii) Matrix:- It is also used for grouping & summarizing with the help of Rows & Columns.
                        (iv) Joined:- Here Multiple reports are joined together to form a Single Report.

(4) Report filter:- Filtering out the essential data of a Report based on a condition & hiding the unneccessary data .
--------------------


Report Filter can be done in two ways:-
---------------------------------------

With Formula:-
-----------------
(a)  Row-level Formulas:- This , we can use to quickly/in a faster way filter out the data , by creating a formula , placing it in the 		          Reports Page ,So that by just clicking on it, we can easily filter out the data .

                        Ex:- Finding the sales report of the State where State='Odisha'.
		=> One Report can contain only One Row-Level Formula.

(b) Summary Formulas:- Used to have Aggregate function results.
		   i.e. In order to have some Sum,Average based Results.
		 
		  Ex:- Total Revenue Collected by the Team.
		       Maximum Products sold in the previous month.

	=> One Report can contain maximum of 5 Summary Forumulas.

Without Formula:-
-----------------------
(a) Bucket Columns:- It is the Way to Filter out the data without having any Formulas......


(5) Subscribing to Reports:-
   -------------------------

Now we have fully created the Reports:-    
	=> So the Reports can be accessed by subscribing to it...
	=> The subscribers can get the Reports via their Emails either daily/weekly/monthly.

(6) Exporting the Reports (it is based on exporting the Reports , to the Subscribers in a particular extension file).
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    It can be done in two ways:-
	(i) Formatted Report:- We particularly use .XLSX to export the Formatted Reports where Formatted Reports contains data 			       represented in a Visulized manner.
	(ii) Details only view:- Here We use .XLS or .CSV format to Export only detailed/text based data.


(7) Security of Reports and Dashboards:-
   ----------------------------------------
   (a) The Reports and Dashboards are placed inside the Folders , which can be accesed based on the Permissions as well as the access          level.
	The Operations are:- 
		(i) View:- One can only view the Folder ---> Reports & dashboards.
        	(ii) Edit:- One non-owner of the folder who can edit the folder if permitted.
		(iii) Manage:- The Owner of the Folder who manages everything.



DashBoards:---
----------------------
=> Reports does have Charts to Visually Show up the Data , But It's better to have DashBoards in order to segregate the working of Report Building & Report Display. & Dashboards also provide mutliple components apart from Charts to visualize the data.
=> That's how Dashboards came into the picture.
=> Dashboard take up the Reports and visualize their datas through the Dashboard Components.

So A dashboard consists of:-

(1) Dashboard Components:- 
  --------------------------
   => Data can be visualized in a dashboard through the help of dashboard components like :- Graphs , Charts, gaudges , line-charts,
		metrics, pie-charts , vertical bar charts, horizontal bar charts, pies, funnels etc.
		
(2) Dashboard Filters:- 
  --------------------------
 => We can filter out the data in a dashboard using the Dashboard filters.

(3) Dashboard Subscription:-
------------------------------
   Same as the Report Subscription.

(4) Static Dashboard vs Dynamic Dashboard:-
  ------------------------------------------
  => Here Static Dashboard are the normal dashboards where data can be related to multiple users.....
     Ex:- Showing the sales of a product in a Region / State / Country.

  => Dynamic Dashboards are the specific dashboards where data is related to a single user. 
	For Ex:- An Employee's Personal information/private information.

So Tip is :-
    => Create Static dashboards whenever you want display Organisational level data.
    => Create Dynamic dashboards whenevr you want to display personal / private data.

(5) Reports & Dashboard Security:- Same as we have seen in Reports.(Above).
